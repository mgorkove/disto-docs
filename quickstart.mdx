## Create a Disto Account

Go to Disto’s [sign-up page](https://app.distoai.com/sign-up) to create a new account.

Enter your email, password, and password confirmation.

## Create a Project

Once you’ve created your account, you can create a project to start using Disto. A project connects your Github repo to Disto so that Disto will be able to create pull requests to fix issues in your code.

1. Go to the [projects page](https://app.distoai.com/projects). Click “Create Project”

2. To connect your Github repos to Disto, Disto first needs to be granted access to them. To grant access, click “Connect Disto to Github” and follow the prompts.

3. When you are redirected back to Disto, you can use the dropdowns to choose the repo name and branch that you want to add to your project. Then click “Create Project”.

## Connect Disto to Sentry

Connect Disto to Sentry so that Disto can receive information about your Sentry errors.

1. Create an internal Sentry integration to allow Disto’s webhook to receive your error events. Go to the Sentry console. Click on “Settings” -> “Developer Settings”

2. Click on “Create New Integration” -> “Internal Integration”. Follow the instructions below according to which Sentry plan you have.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I have a Sentry Business or Enterprise plan">
    Fill out the fields exactly as in the below screenshots. Click “Save
    Changes”.

    After you click "Save Changes", a token should appear.

    Copy this token, paste it into the box on the Disto "Connect Logs" page, and click "Add Token" to add this token to your Disto account. This will allow Disto to access your Sentry error information.

3. To associate your Disto project with your Sentry project, copy your Sentry DSN into the box on the Disto "Connect Logs" page and click "Add DSN".

You are now done with setup! Disto will automatically receive error events from Sentry and create fixes.

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when setting up Disto.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repo does not show up in the dropdown on the 'Create Project' page">
    If you don’t see the repo that you want to add, make sure Disto has access
    to it. Go to https://github.com/settings/installations , click on “DistoAI”,
    then click “All Repositories”, or select specific ones. You can then go back
    to the “create project” page in Disto, refresh the page, and see the repos
    you just selected show up in the dropdowns.
