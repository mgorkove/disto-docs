title: Self-Hosting Disto
description: ""
---

You can run Disto on your own infrastructure. This means that your data does not leave your environment, and you are running a dedicated LLM that is private to your company.

## Model

Disto uses [StarChat](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta) as its underlying LLM. StarChat is a fine-tuned version of [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoderbase), a state-of-the-art open-source LLM trained on code.

## Hardware Requirements

Disto runs in a Kubernetes cluster. For a POC, it requires 2 nodes. One node runs the LLM, and the other runs the rest of the services that Disto is composed of. For a production deployment, we will work with you to size the cluster based on your needs.

## Deployment

We will provide a script to you that will create the Kubernetes cluster and deploy Disto. We support deployment on AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-prem hardware or a different cloud provider if requested.

After Disto is deployed, its frontend service will be accessible via URL. Then you can access the Disto UI.

## Security

Since Disto is deployed on your own infrastructure, none of your data ever leaves your environment. We will work with your team to ensure we meet any other security requirements you have.

## User Pool

If you are self hosting, you will need to create an AWS Cognito User Pool. Navigate to Cognito in the AWS console and click Create User Pool to get started. 
Proceed through the setup instructions.

1. Select Email under Cognito user pool sign-in options

3. Select Public client, name it Disto or another name you would like, and select "Don't generate a client secret".

Once the user pool is created, you will need to add two environment variables. 
1. **USER_POOL_ID**
You can find this at the top of your user pool page.

2. **AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID**
Navigate to App integration, and scroll to the bottom to find this.

## S3 Bucket

If you are self hosting, you will also need to create an Amazon S3 Bucket. Navigate to S3 in the AWS console and click Create Bucket to get started. 
Name your bucket, and select your region and security settings.

Once the bucket is created, you will need to add the following environment variable. 
1. **S3_BUCKET_NAME**
Set this to the name of the bucket you just created
