---

You can run Disto on your own infrastructure. This means that your data does not leave your environment, and you are running a dedicated LLM that is private to your company.

## Security

Since Disto is deployed on your own infrastructure, none of your data ever leaves your environment. We will work with your team to ensure we meet any other security requirements you have.

## Deployment

To deploy Disto, follow the instructions under the "Self-Hosting Disto" section for your cloud provider.
