title: Deploy Disto
description: ""
---

## Introduction

Disto runs in its own Kubernetes cluster in your AWS environment.
You can run Disto's deploy script to create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy Disto on it.

## Prerequisites

You will need to provide the values for the following arguments:

- `aws-region`: the region you want to deploy Disto to.
- `aws-access-key-id`: your AWS access key
- `aws-secret-access-key`: your AWS secret access key

You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) to obtain your access key and secret access key, or create new ones.

- `s3-bucket-name`: name of S3 bucket that will store configuration files.

Follow the instructions [here](s3) to create an S3 bucket.

- `cognito-user-pool-id`: name of your AWS Cognito user pool for managing Disto user accounts.
- `cognito-client-id`: your AWS Cognito client ID

Follow the instructions [here](user-pool) to create a user pool and client ID.

- `sagemaker-endpoint-name`: The name of the endpoint from the deployed Sagemaker LLM.
- `sagemaker-region-name`: your Sagemaker region name.

Follow the instructions [here](sagemaker) to deploy Disto's LLM on Sagemaker.

## Deployment

After you have obtained these values, follow the steps below.

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:

   - Shell environment with `eksctl`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the disto-deploy repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mgorkove/disto-deploy
   cd disto-deploy/
   ```

3. Run the aws-deploy script

   ```sh
   chmod +x ./aws-deploy.sh
   ./aws-deploy.sh \
    --s3-bucket-name "your_s3_bucket_name" \
    --aws-region "your_aws_region" \
    --cognito-user-pool-id "your_cognito_user_pool_id" \
    --cognito-client-id "your_cognito_client_id" \
    --sagemaker-endpoint-name "your_sagemaker_endpoint_name" \
    --sagemaker-region-name "your_sagemaker_region_name" \
    --aws-access-key-id "your_aws_access_key_id" \
    --aws-secret-access-key "your_aws_secret_access_key"
   ```

After the script is done, it will output the following:

    ```sh
    Access services via: <URL>
    ```

You can copy the URL into your browser and start using Disto.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io">
    The ingress controller may not have been created at the time the rest of the resources were deployed. Run the following command again:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
    ```
  </Accordion>
