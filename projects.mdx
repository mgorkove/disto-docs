Disto is organized by projects. A project corresponds to one application and the systems that Disto needs to retrieve information from when solving an issue related to it.

## Create a Project

Once you’ve set up your integrations, you can create a project.

1. Click on "Projects" in the navigation bar. Click “Create Project”

2. All of your installed integrations will appear here. You can select which of these you want Disto to use when solving issues related to this project.

3. For example, let's say that your application is running in a Kubernetes cluster. Selecting GitHub allows you to select the relevant repo(s), and selecting Kubernetes allows you to select the read only kubeconfig so that Disto can retrieve information about Kubernetes resources via read-only kubectl commands.

4. If you have alerts set up in another tool, Disto can receive an event via webhook whenever an alert is triggered, and automatically start investigating the issue. If you are using a common tool that Disto has an integration for, you can follow the prompts in the Disto UI to set up a webhook when you're creating a project.

We currently support alerting from PagerDuty, StatusCake, Prometheus, and Opsgenie.

5. After clicking the Create Project button, your project is ready and will start receiving alerts and solving issues.
