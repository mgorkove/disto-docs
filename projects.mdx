## Create a Project

Once you’ve set up your integrations, you can create a project. Disto organizes issues into projects based on the data sources and alerts you choose when customizing your project. 

1. Go to the [Projects page](https://app.distoai.com/projects). Click “Create Project”

2. All of your installed integrations will appear here. You can select which of these you want Disto to pull information from in this project.

3. Let's say that you want to track a Kubernetes cluster along with the code for a particular service. Selecting Kubernetes and GitHub allows you to select the relevant repo(s) and the read only kubeconfig so that Disto can pull information about the pods.

You can also set up alerting so that this Disto project is automatically notified of any issues and can start solving them immediately. 

4. After clicking the Create Project button, your project is ready and will start receiving alerts and solving issues.
