An issue is any problem that Disto solves. This could be a crash in your application, or a performance issue, or something else that triggers an alert.

If Disto receives an alert via webhook, it will automatically start solving the issue, and you can view the results by following the steps below. You can also manually create an issue.

## View Issues

1. Click on "Projects" in the navigation bar, and click on your project.

3. If you click "Show Investigation Steps", you can see the steps that Disto took to investigate the issue, each of which include what command, query, or API call it performed, the result, and analysis of the result.

   Click Submit, and wait for Disto to process the issue and add it to your project.
