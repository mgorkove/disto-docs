## Integrations with Common Tools

Disto currently integrates with the following common tools:

1. Github
2. Kubernetes
3. Prometheus
4. VictoriaMetrics
5. Sentry
6. NewRelic

Alerting:

1. PagerDuty
2. StatusCake
3. Opsgenie

The following integrations will be added soon:

1. OpenSearch
2. Datadog

If there are common tools that you would like to connect that are not listed above, please let us know and we will add integrations for those.

To connect one of these tools to Disto, click "Install" under the name of the tool. Then, follow the steps below for that tool. The process is very simple - it should take a few clicks and around 5 minutes per tool to set up the integration.

## GitHub

Disto will redirect you to GitHub where you can install the Disto app to your selected repos.

## Kubernetes

To integrate with Kubernetes, run the command provided by Disto to create a read-only kubeconfig, and upload this securely to Disto. This will allow Disto to run read-only kubectl commands to get data from your cluster.

## Prometheus

To integrate with Prometheus, fill out the indicated fields.

Once integrated, to receive alerts from Prometheus, select Prometheus when creating a project and follow the instructions to allow alerts to be sent to that project.

## Sentry

Connect Disto to Sentry so that Disto can receive information about your Sentry errors.

1. Create an internal Sentry integration to allow Disto’s webhook to receive your error events. Go to the Sentry console. Click on “Settings” -> “Developer Settings”

2. Click on “Create New Integration” -> “Internal Integration”. Follow the instructions below according to which Sentry plan you have.

  <Accordion title="I have a Sentry Business or Enterprise plan">
    Fill out the fields exactly as in the below screenshots. Click “Save
    Changes”.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have a Sentry Developer or Team plan">
    Fill out the fields exactly as in the below screenshots. Click “Save
    Changes”.

    <img height="70" src="/images/sentry-internal-integration-instructions1.png" />

    After you click "Save Changes", a token should appear.

    <img height="70" src="/images/sentry_copy_token_instructions.png" />

    Copy this token into Disto and click "Add Token" to add this token to your Disto account. This will allow Disto to access your Sentry error information.

## Custom Integrations

We will build custom integrations for your internal tools, and have them ready by the time you would like to begin a POC. We want to minimize the engineering effort required from your team. We would need documentation on your internal tools and any APIs they have.

If you would like to add an integration yourself, you can do so by following the steps below.

Click on "Add Custom Integration" and fill out the indicated fields. These will give Disto information about what data can be retrieved from your tools and how to retrieve it.

1. Name: Display name of the integration
2. URL: The destination URL Disto will make a request to when retrieving data from this tool.
3. Auth: Basic auth credentials or authorization header to use when making the request.
4. Custom HTTP Headers: Custom HTTP Headers to add to the request
5. Add each endpoint of the tool you want Disto to have access to and the following information about it:
   1. endpoint (e.g. /api/v1/logs)
   2. description
   3. parameters
   4. response schema
   5. error responses

<img height="70" src="/images/add_custom_integration.png" />

If the fields above are not appropriate for a tool that you would like to integrate, please let us know and we will add functionality to enable integration with that tool.
