## What is Disto?

Disto is your AI on-call engineer. When a production incident happens, Disto uses large language models to automatically identify the root cause and create a pull request with the fix in minutes.

Currently, Disto integrates with Sentry to fix errors that Sentry detects in your application.

If there are any other integrations you would like, or if you have feedback or questions, please contact me (Masha, the founder of Disto) at masha@distoai.com. I would love to hear from you.

Follow the instructions on the "Quickstart" page to get started with Disto in 5 minutes.
