## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when setting up Disto.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repo does not show up in the dropdown on the 'Create Project' page">
    If you don’t see the repo that you want to add, make sure Disto has access
    to it. Go to https://github.com/settings/installations , click on “DistoAI”,
    then click “All Repositories”, or select specific ones. You can then go back
    to the “create project” page in Disto, refresh the page, and see the repos
    you just selected show up in the dropdowns.
