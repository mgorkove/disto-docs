## Auth Tokens

Authentication tokens are passed using an auth header, and are used to authenticate as a user account with the API. In our documentation, we have several placeholders that appear between curly braces, such as {auth_token}, which you will need to replace with one of your authentication tokens in order to use the API call effectively.

For example, when the documentation says:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer {auth_token}' http://{your_disto_url}/api/v1/projects/
```

If your authentication token is 1a2b3c, then the command should be:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer 1a2b3c' http://{your_disto_url}/api/v1/projects/
```

You can create authentication tokens within Disto by going to Account > Security Credentials > Create New Auth Token.
