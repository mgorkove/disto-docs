title: Deploy Disto
description: ""
---

## Introduction

Disto runs in its own Kubernetes cluster in your GCP environment.
You can run Disto's deploy script to create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy Disto on it.

## Prerequisites

You will need to provide the values for the following arguments:

- `region`: the GCP region you want to deploy Disto to. Example: us-central1

- `firestore-region`: the GCP region of the Disto Firestore database. Disto stores project and issue information in Firestore. Supported locations can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations)

- `newrelic-account-id`: (optional) your New Relic account ID, if you want to link New Relic to Disto.

If you do not know your New Relic acccount ID, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/) to obtain it.

- `firebase-credentials-path`: path to file with your Firebase credentials.

Follow the instructions [here](firebase) to create a Firebase project and get the credentials file.

## Deployment

After you have obtained these values, follow the steps below.

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:

   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the disto-deploy repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mgorkove/disto-deploy
   cd disto-deploy/gcp
   ```

3. Run the gcp-deploy script

   ```sh
   chmod +x ./gcp-deploy.sh
   ./gcp-deploy.sh \
    --region "your_gcp_region" \
    --firestore-region "your_firestore_db_region" \
    --newrelic-account-id "your_newrelic_account_id" \
    --firebase-credentials-path "path_to_your_firebase_credentials_file"
   ```

After the script is done, it will output the following:

    ```sh
    Access services via: <URL>
    ```

You can copy the URL into your browser and start using Disto.
